# Your Own Adventure  

### Presentation:
This code was created with propuse of learn the languege Python and  I try to do something funny that you can play and look the code.


### Explanation:
- **Class**: This code contains a class called Npcs that his functions is very simple, output of the dialogues of some npcs in the game, in the file called npcs.py,


```python
    

    class Npcs:
            """Class Npc contains all persons of the games, return dialogues and contain the information of the enemies"""
		...
```

- **Functions:** There are some functions, one in the folder that contains the choices for two paths:

```python
    def choice_right_for_the_forest(
        weapon: list, answer_weapon: list, skills_attacks: dict, spells_atacks: dict
    ) -> str:
	"This method prints the choices made by the user, killing a enemy, talking the right path"`
```

 and another with his use is the same. 
 
 - There is another funtions that makes a new file .txt that contains information about your inventory in the end of the history: 
 
 ```python

    def inventory_file():
        "Make a ner file .txt with your inventory in the end of the history"

```


 - **Elections:** This adventure you only to select the options that the program says. **Do not write something different to the options**

####  - Things to keep in mind:
 - You need to have install python 3.0 or higher
 - If you write a invalid option maybe the code could repeat the question, but is something that you do not need to be worry about it.
